## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?

A method allows me to set a value to something and recall it throughout my program.

1. In the space below, create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.

def hello(greeting)
  puts greeting
end

hello("Sam I am")

1. Create a method name `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.

def hello_someone(name)
  puts "#{name} I am"
end

1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?

hello_someone("Sam")
